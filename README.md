# Top-Monthly-Sales
This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing and visualizing monthly sales data.
The main goal of this project is to aggregate sales data by month, identify trends, and visualize these insights in a clear and informative way.

This project involves analyzing customer transaction data to identify key sales trends, customer purchasing patterns, and engagement levels. The data consists of transactions with attributes such as transaction date, amount, and customer response, which indicates churn or retention.

The analysis includes:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Merging transaction and response data, handling missing values, and converting data types for seamless analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing transaction distributions, identifying monthly trends, and finding the top three months with the highest sales.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Applying an RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis to classify customers into segments based on recent purchase date, transaction frequency, and total spending. Segments include P0 (high engagement), P1 (moderate engagement), and P2 (low engagement).
4. **Churn and Retention Analysis**: Determining the distribution of churned and active customers.
5. **Top Customer Analysis**: Identifying top customers by order count and total transaction value, with visualizations showing their monthly contributions via pie charts.
